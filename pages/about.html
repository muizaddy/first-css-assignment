    <h1>This is Our About Page</h1>
    <p>
      Capacity Bay is a community focused on collaboration, communication and
      creation. They look forward to drawing out people that are passionate and
      are willing to learn from the darkness they are in. They ensure that
      everyone in the community feels like a family and make them feel they are
      in the right place. CapacityBay will someday be a super Organization. They
      are doing what hrdly anyone else can do. throughout of my years of
      research Ive never seen an individualor NGO's willing to do this great
      work. Most organizations are all about money but capacity bay is about
      Purpose. They have a very strong purpose and by God's assistance they will
      change the world for the better.
